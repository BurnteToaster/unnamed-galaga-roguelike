# [UNNAMED] Galaga Roguelike Game
 My first game in Rust using Bevy

 Similar to Galaga, you're a spaceship at the bottom of the screen moving only along the x-axis shooting at enemies above. You have enemies that move in a snake-like pattern and then move down when they get close to the bottom.

# CONTROLS
- Mouse cursor = aim
- Left click = shoot
- Scroll wheel down = left
- Scroll wheel up = right
- Right click = slow down time

# TODO
- Colliders for everything
- UI and score system
- Simple start/game over screen
- NEED to reorganise my files (not keeping everything in main.rs lol)
