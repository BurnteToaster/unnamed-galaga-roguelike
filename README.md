# [UNNAMED] Galaga Roguelike Game
 My first game in Rust using Bevy

 Similar to Galaga, you're a spaceship at the bottom of the screen moving only along the x-axis shooting at enemies above. You have enemies that move in a snake-like pattern and then move down when they get close to the bottom.

# CONTROLS
- Mouse cursor = aim
- Left click = shoot
- Scroll wheel down = left
- Scroll wheel up = right
- Right click = slow down time

# TODO
- Need to add main menu for last collider
- UI and score system
- Simple start/game over screen

# COPYRIGHT
i literally don't care, use my code
